# Explanation:
HTML Structure:
The <a> tag wraps a <div> with the class plus.
CSS:
The .plus class sets the initial background image (vol_off.webp), width, height, and no-repeat properties.
The .plus.minus class sets the background image to vol_on.webp when the minus class is added, while retaining the same dimensions and no-repeat property.
JavaScript:
The script includes the jQuery library.
It adds a click event listener to elements with the class plus, toggling the minus class on click.
This code will toggle the background image of the .plus div between vol_off.webp and vol_on.webp when clicked.
